# Game Engine Tutorial
*Mr. Miyoshi’s Beginning Programming / Game Programming Class*

This tutorial will walk you through the process of creating your own game, starting with a barebones project and building up to a 
complete game with user input, game objects, collisions, and more. Along the way we’ll explore each piece of the game in-depth. 
After working through this tutorial you’ll be able to use the skills you’ve learned to make any kind of game you’d like.

See Game Engine Tutorial.pdf for a full step-by-step tutorial.

## Setup in VS2019

### Option #1: clone from GitHub with VS2019

1) Make sure you are logged into your GitHub account.  Fork this repo by clicking on the Fork button in the top right corner of this web page.  This will make an exact copy of this repository in your own GitHub account.  (Note: This step does not pull the repository down to your local computer.)
1) Launch VS2019.
1) Click “Clone or check out code”
1) Paste in `https://github.com/[Your GitHub username]/WilliamsGameEngineVS2019.git` and click Clone.  (You can get the link by going to your forked repository on your GitHub account, and pressing the copy link button.)
1) After it finishes cloning, open Solution Explorer with View -> Solution Explorer
1) Open Base Project -> MyGame and double-click MyGame.sln
1) This should open the solution and the tool bar should now contain a run button with “Debug, Win32, Local Windows Debugger”.
1) Press play and see it compile and run, showing a blank window ready for the tutorial to start.

### Option #2 (only use this option if you are NOT using GitHub): download a .zip file

1) Go to https://github.com/MichaelTMiyoshi/WilliamsGameEngineVS2019
1) Click on the green “Clone or Download”
1) Click on “Download Zip” to download a copy of the repository
1) Unzip the files to wherever you’d like.
1) Navigate to Base Project -> MyGame within the new directory and double-click MyGame.sln.
1) This should open the solution and the tool bar should now contain a run button with “Debug, Win32, Local Windows Debugger”.
1) Press play and see it compile and run, showing a blank window ready for the tutorial to start.


## Updates to the Tutorial
