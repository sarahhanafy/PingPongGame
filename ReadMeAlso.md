Another couple notes (from Miyoshi) about the tutorial:

There are a couple typos in the tutorial.  They are there for two reasons.

1. I did not want to edit the PDF file.
1. I like people to think about what they are doing rather than mindlessly type.

You will need to know at least a little about classes to do the tutorial.  And of course, you will need the fundamentals of programming in C++ that we have been learning in class (and at home).

Have fun.  This is what many of you have been waiting for.  The culmination of all your hard work.

Thank you again to Eric Williams for writing this tutorial many years ago.
Thank you Mike Magruder for getting it ready for this next group of students, and for teaching me about GitHub.
